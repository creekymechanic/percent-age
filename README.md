# percent-age
a simple js script website to display the current date as a percentage.


to do:

- fix edges of border on the progress bar to not overlap
- make an animation for when it hits the new year
- round % text to 1 or 2 decimal points
- get custom font
- add drop shaddows

maybe:
- add lots of decimal points so you can see it update in real time (hard)
- add counter of how many people on the website
- add other stats like days passed, hours passed, seconds passed, etc.
